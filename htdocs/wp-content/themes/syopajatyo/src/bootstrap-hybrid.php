/**
 * Hybrid Core - A WordPress theme development framework.
 *
 * Hybrid Core is a framework for developing WordPress themes.  The framework
 * allows theme developers to quickly build themes without having to handle all
 * of the "logic" behind the theme or having to code complex functionality for
 * features that are often needed in themes.  The framework does these things
 * for developers to allow them to get back to what matters the most:  developing
 * and designing themes. Themes handle all the markup, style, and scripts while
 * the framework handles the logic.
